          "answer":
            "Johanna: I am starting a clothing line which is based on what I was looking for and couldn't find. The starting point was a dress - I wanted to find a really simple dress, that I knew I could just pick up and wear whether for working or for going out somewhere. I guess that's due to the fact, that I'm a mum now and in the morning you have to think about what your kid is going to wear, what you're going to wear... And from that it just sort of grew into other garments that I had inspiration for. Also there was a strong need for me to make the clothes myself. I love making so the handmade aspect is a really important part of it. And to go further: I am really interested in where things are coming from and where things are made, as well as natural materials and natural dyes. I love nature, gardening and I thought: maybe I start with dying my own textiles to get to know the whole process. I am not weaving my own fabrics, although we discussed with Noemi the idea of growing our own dying plants, linen…and weaving our own fabric, but I think that is a little bit optimistic for now. (smiling)"

          "question": "Do you dye all the clothes or do you leave some naturally?",
          "answer":
            "There are basic pieces in their natural colours, pieces in dark indigo and in light indigo. With time I will introduce new colours according to a plant, a place or something that I find interesting."

          "question": "Was it difficult to find the right suppliers for the textiles?",
          "answer":
            "Yes. You can easily find organic textiles, but they might be coming from very far away. So some of the fabrics I use are linen based, that come from France, which is very close, and the 100% cotton comes from India. I really wanted to find something closer, but that's impossible, because cotton doesn't grow here. I think the alternative would be to find recycled cotton or work with local fibres. But yes, it's quite difficult to find suppliers, so perhaps going to a textile fair would be good for the future productions - or growing my own linen (laughing)."

          "question": "Are you careful with what you shop yourself?",
          "answer":
            "Yes of course, I always look at the tags: where it's made, what's the fabric. I feel nowadays that there is a big distance between the consumer and their understanding of where the products are coming from, how it's made... the younger generation it feels, doesn't seem to have an idea about how things come about. There isn't that culture anymore of sewing, knitting with your grandmother or baking... . In parallel to that, there is a group of people who are not satisfied with what's going on. These people can be quite strong about their opinion, sometimes a little extreme. I think it would be nice, if the alternative to the mainstream production would become something more natural. I will certainly communicate about the fact that the clothes are made and dyed by me here in Brussels, but I do not want it to be the focal point, I just want to show it and then let people decide. Another problem is that we are so used to see low prices, mainly for garments, so it's probably going to be difficult at first to get people to realize why it's that price. But if you go to H&M every Saturday and spend 20€ over ten weeks, that's 200€ - you are better off buying a nice top for 200€. That's the way to look at it! The quality of H&M and all these kind of brands is very low, the production isn't based on fairness, the fabric, the colours are very..."

        {
          "images": [],
          "question": "yeah, and also the quality of the sewing: you wash it and it lost it's shape!",
          "answer":
            "yes - it looks great on a hanger, but it's a 5 minute greatness."

        {
          "images": [],
          "question": "So what is the thing you look for, before you decide to buy something?",
          "answer":
            "The most important thing for me is where it's made. If it's organic is the second thing I look at. When I see brands like APC - which is a brand that I look up to, its founder is very forward thinking and doing his thing and doing it quite well - but when I see that the garments are made in China, I just think: aargh... I heard an interview with him the other day where he said: I have to produce in China - I'd love to do it in France, but I can't, the prices are too high. And anyway, there aren't that many people prepared or able to do this stuff, so I have to do it in China. And I felt a bit like: yes - but you also want to do a good profit margin, and that you're not saying. You know, I fear that when I see that companies are making garments in Bangladesh or China, that they are being greedy and that makes me feel uncomfortable."

            "Yes, well, that's the same thing. What's better? Buying potatoes that are grown in Belgium or organic ones that come from the other side of the planet? The organic thing is a bit tricky, so I'm trying to buy seasonal."

          "answer":
            "Women with children who have managed to build a company, I'm fascinated how they combine both. I really enjoy looking at how they started and what motivated them. It's always fantastic stories (smiles), like the one of Anita Roddick, who set up THE BODY SHOP. Her husband was going to South America for a year, and she was left with the kids and thought: ok, what am I going to do, I need to make money! So she started making beauty products with natural things like avocado and yoghurt, chose eco-friendly packaging and opened a little shop that became this massive brand!"

          "question": "When was this?",
          "answer":
            "I think it was in the late 70's. What was clever: she was against animal testing and quite strong about it, telling people: you know, the lipstick you're buying is horrible, look at what they're doing to these poor rabbits! It sort of shook people up a bit and made them realize: it's insane what we're doing! And it's good that it became something quite mainstream. But then, like most of these companies, a big group bought her brand and it becomes something very different."

          "question": "Where did you grow up?",
          "answer":
            "In the South West of France, in the Pyrenees. My parents lived in a small village close to Lourdes and I went to a very small school: we were three in my class. I loved it - we were skiing every Tuesday - there was a very natural environment. Then in my teenage years my parents moved to a bigger city which was perfect, as a teenager you just hate everything that is natural, you think it's boring - a bit of a shock though as suddenly I was in a class of 30 and we were all the same age (smiling)! In my late teens and early twenties I decided to learn English, so I went to England. The idea was to come back to France to study architecture, but then I really enjoyed England and I discovered, that you could study very specific subjects like furniture, or textiles. So I ended up staying in England for quite a few years, working as a furniture designer but always using textiles in my work."

          "question": "And what brought you to Brussels?",
          "answer":
            "Sylvain [Willenz] did. I already knew Brussels and liked the city, it felt very low key. Belgian people are laid back and modest. Everyone is doing their own thing and I really enjoy that."

          "question": "How did the decision to start your own business come up?",
          "answer":
            "When I came to Brussels, I was struggling to find a job in the furniture design field. I had plenty of experience, I had done quite a lot of things, but still... so I got really frustrated, I love working. I helped Sylvain with his business, but I needed my own thing.  I started making crochet mushrooms (laughing). That was nice and I kept going and then thought: ok, what can you do? You can sew. You don't have much money, a little sewing machine, a bit of space: I am going to make collars (because I came across these patterns of crochet collars). I got myself an online shop, did the website myself, took some really nice pictures and wrote to my friends: this is what I'm doing, tell me what you think. And everyone was like: oh - it's really nice… I'm sure it's gonna be doing very well... but not much sales (laughing)! Then I went for a summer holidays in France and on my return I thought to myself: OK, this needs to work, I haven't done all this for nothing! So I wrote a nice email to magazines and the French ELLE blog picked up on it. I was very excited that orders started coming through from people I had no idea who they were! The first one was a lady on a French island in the pacific, so cool! And she bought two! Not just one! (smiling). It then became a bit of a snowball thing. But for me, I realise now, CLAUDINE & COMPAGNIE was a bit of a test. It got me to understand a lot of things and so I'm starting this new brand with a bit more experience."

            "Researching, meeting people, looking at how other people are doing things and always have the energy to keep going! Sometimes I felt like: what am I doing? Is this a bit silly? You know, I never made clothes before. But there's something inside you that says: no! I think I'm doing something different and I'm sure there are people who'll appreciate it. I just gotta keep going and see what happens. Don't question things too much!"

            "Leron/Marcus: We hunt juice recipes, gather all the ingredients for them and then squeeze fruits and vegetables to make really good juices! We use a cold pressed juicer - it's a hydraulic press - so it doesn't heat any of the fruits and vegetables we're squeezing. A lot of people believe, that this keeps all the enzymes and all the nutrients in them. Essentially it does, because heat degrades everything. Heat, temperature and time: the big killers of life. Our working style is very casual and comfortable and depends on our friends. And sometimes that's really positive, because we get a lot for free, but sometimes it's really emotional, because people are putting their hearts into something and sometimes they don't feel like they're getting everything back of that."

So I've lived 13 years in Norway and the States, and I'm on my 15th here. Freiburg became home. So I bought an apartment and now we have the store."

I've taught a lot of different things - basically I teach what I don't know, but then you learn it (smiling). So I'm still waiting to grow up, and figure out what I wanna do with my life, but I'm having a lot of fun in the meantime. It's very enjoyable, mainly, I think, because I get to hang out with a whole bunch of really cool, nice, helpful, ambitious and creative people everyday. It doesn't really matter what you do, as long as you're in that kind of environment. So I feel very lucky to know this guy, very lucky to know those people and I have a really good time with them."

We were looking for a project to do - really Marcus was looking for a project, I was looking to leave Freiburg I think - and I was reading the New York Times where I saw an article about juice, and so I was like: ok, I'm not gonna go to Cambridge, let's do juice! And I wrote Marcus: it's juice or something like that. And he was like: ok (laughing). And so then we started working on it - really uncomplicated! (everyone's laughing)"

Because this is so financially challenging for us, we've been doing a crowd-funding campaign. I don't think I've realised the financial amount this would cost.

They bring in the mass majority regionally, from Kaiserstuhl or from Elsass, but they also source food from everywhere in the world for the more exotic things like ginger or pineapple, or whatever doesn't grow so well in this area. We like to offer people a combination of flavours and nutrition that aren't necessarily all available here, so we just try to make sure that it's fair, organic, sustainable as possible and then serve it up."

When I was there, they gave me the book about the founder of SWEDESE and it was totally inspiring! He was working on everything: designing the furniture, designing the logo, the catalogues, even the building of the company. So that's when the first thoughts came up, but just as an abstract idea. And then slowly - I continued working for other brands - this idea was growing and growing. I liked the idea to work on the whole project, from conception to production. Also to create a collection, not just a single product for one brand and then a different one for another brand, but to have a complete range that reflects more the atmosphere that I like to design and to have more freedom in the way to design, having my own brand."

But then I moved studios and found this place, that allows me to have a shop - which is more a showroom than a shop, because I'm not in a commercial area at all. So people that come here are people who know my products. But I'm really glad I have that place! People get to see the furniture in real. My online shop is more an online catalogue at the moment, but still I do get requests through it - I couldn't really say if I have more sales online, or in the shop. But for me it's really important to have the physical shop."

          "answer":
            "Pauline: It actually was pretty random that we got in contact with the guys who came up with the project. The concept originates from PERNOD RICARD, the second largest brand producing spirits. They thought they should get into the latest trend of producing hand manufactured local products, and after some time this concept by their innovation team came forward: a local product within a global project. Berlin was their first chosen city and through some circumstances they came to us. We already had an agency PAULSANDERS GMBH, focusing on marketing, PR and event  management for big brands. OUR/VODKA were actually looking for someone unfamiliar with the liquor business and we were taken by the product, the quality and had ideas to combine many things we were already doing with this new project - all under one roof. But I would have never guessed how much fun it can be to form a brand from the beginning to the end!"

            "Well, RICARD built with all their knowledge the distillery and then handed us the keys over, so we'd be the management and look after production, marketing, sales and distribution. Now we are 100% free to shape the brand - so cooperation is limited to talking on the phone every fortnight, when they call to see, if we're doing good and if they can help us in any way.

          "answer":
            "Sure, totally - we don't really notice all the partying around as we are here weekdays from 10-6. But to have many clubs and bars close by surely makes a good link to vodka. It wasn't easy to find a suitable spot for the distillery actually, as you are not allowed to have anyone on top or underneath your business, because of the danger of explosion.

The key is: we are here, producing the product here, in Berlin, and everyone can come and check it out - it's no fake. And the product is good, the design simple... there is no comparable vodka bottle in the world, that is small and cute, still very stylish and that's got premium vodka inside, which is very good value for its price. Also, what helped us a lot, was that we took a different route than usual alcohol seller: we asked our friends with concept-stores like VOO-STORE and WOODWOOD to add our vodka to their collection, that created much attention. Plus, that I used to work in a press agency and had many contacts from that helped heaps."
